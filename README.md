# PDFMerger
I've created this tool just to be able to merge our team's graduation project' proposal PDF documents (we created each document separately :"( )

## What's it missing?
Well, document selection is currently done one by one (ordering issue with tKinter library)
- Add multiple file selection

## How to use
- Clone the project but firstly install the requirements from `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Or download the executable program from [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/jatgxfns4m2zevk/MergGradPdfProject.rar/file)

### I named it MergGradPdfProject (I literally named it while writing this line, just thought it's cool to have a name, don't mind the cringe name)
